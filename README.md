Twitter reactions on iPhone7 using Sentiment Analysis and Social Media Mining with Python

# ABSTRACT
Apple Inc., launched its latest flagship smartphone -iPhone 7 in 2016. Apple’s iPhone is immensely popular in United States. In 2016, Apple Inc. has introduced significant changes in the device model such as removal of 3.5 mm headphone jack, introduction of wireless headphones, new color options etc. With this paper we introduce an approach to discover user's sentiments from tweets about iPhone7. The sentiments discovered are majorly classified in 3 broad categories - positive, negative and neutral. We further classified these sentiments based on user's gender and location. We focused on US only location. Our approach can be useful for product companies who want to gauge public opinions about their product in the market and determine the target audience based on consumer's gender and location. Our work can be helpful to get more insights on user's sentiments based on i) gender and ii) location. Our method presents the results of supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying the sentiment of tweets. This paper also describes the preprocessing steps required to perform sentiment analysis using social media mining.
